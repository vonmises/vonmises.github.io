Why do programmers [claim to] design things around a singular concept? Even in the real world, it's still not clear that everything is made up of a single building block at the lowest levels.

In software:

* everything is a list (Lisp)
* everything is a file (UNIX)
* everything is a term (Prolog)
* everything is an object ([strict] OOP languages)
* everything is an expression (Mathematica)
* everything can be referenced by a URL (Firebase)

There may be other examples of the above (and in some cases--e.g. Lisp, some might stress the phrase "almost everything") but I'm only mentioning the products about which I usually hear the above phrases, and often from the creators or biggest contributors.

The reason I find it curious is that, given similar things, e.g. programming languages, it's strange that many languages designed by extremely bright people, would choose one concept and design everything around it. It's likely that that concept is not the right implementation choice for some things, or someone's entire language is fairly poorly designed...or, we're just overstating things.

It's probably just to give newcomers the most prominent feature about the language but I think it can throw some people off when when it's stated too strongly.
