I'm currently using a book called Python Algorithms to learn about the regular algorithms that you are expected to know midway through a typical CS programme. "Currently" meaning I'm on Chapter One as I write this, so I can't give anything impressive right now, but hopefully in a week or two I'll be more enlightened.
