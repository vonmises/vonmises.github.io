                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    I have worked in the industry developing .NET applications and am currently transitioning
                    to other languages and platforms. My current interests are python, machine learning,
                    data science, and mobile applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beyond programming and information technology, I'm interested in economics, physics, mathematics, logic, and&mdash;in some sense&mdash;sociology. I'm curious about everything, though, but these are some of the things I try to learn more about on my own time and with my own effort.
                </p>
